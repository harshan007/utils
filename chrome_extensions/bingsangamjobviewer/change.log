Alan Stroop      20091111 1.2     Display xpath in tool tip and text box. Allow file:// protocol.
                                  Display namespace declarations in element. Updated inline xslt
                                  to be a truly well-formed/valid stylesheet.
Alan Stroop      20091206 1.3     Single click displays xpath, double collapses/expands. Fixed
                                  display issue with xpath box on smaller browser windows. Bold
                                  text() nodes. Don't display namespace declaration if parent
                                  node's namespace uri is the same.
Alan Stroop      20091210 1.3.1   Tweaks to stylesheet to reduce html tags. Removed some of the
                                  crusties in stylesheet. Don't create class="inline" ele divs
                                  as it causes display issues and doesn't seem to help in any way.
Alan Stroop      20100104 1.3.2   Exclamation point was missing on opening comment tag.
Alan Stroop      20100110 1.3.3   Added charset=utf-8 to iframe src attribute
Alan Stroop      20100120 1.4.0   Load stylesheet from extension directory. Load jquery.js from
                                  extension directory in rendered output. Attempt parsing of XML
                                  disquised as plain-text. Fixed "illegal return" error.
Alan Stroop      20100214 1.5.0   Added Options page, toggling of banner and trim rendered output.
Alan Stroop      20100215 1.5.1   Added Namespaces in root element option.
Alan Stroop      20100221 1.5.2   Use libxslt's node-set() function, if available, for getting unique
                                  namespaces. Added Debug Mode option.
Alan Stroop      20100317 1.5.3   Added Display XPath Tooltip option. Tweak Help section.
Alan Stroop      20100410 1.6.0   Added Transformation and Render (half-baked) functionality in
                                  new Page Action. Added Line Wrap option.
Alan Stroop      20100610 1.7.0   Changed rendering to replace documentElement instead of using
                                  iframe, see http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=43847
                                  which should also allow for rendering of larger xml documents.
                                  Fixed display issue with multi-line comments only displaying on 
                                  a single line. Root elements with multiple namespaces (xsl, xsd,
                                  wsdl, etc.) defined on it will now render those namespaces and 
                                  not just the root element's namespace. Fixed bug where js error
                                  would be reported due to class name collision on node-start and
                                  namespace when clicking namespace for xpath/collapse. Added Show
                                  Parsing Error option. Upped JQuery to 1.4.2. Code cleanup.
Alan Stroop      20100720 1.7.1   Fixed bug where parsererror node would display when Show Parsing
                                  Error option was set to no.
Alan Stroop      20100728 1.7.2   Needed to modify jquery javascript to add null check on div.style 
                                  when setting div.style.display = "none". Fixes js errors when
                                  rendering tree. Only set unique namespaces variable when Display
                                  Namespaces in Root Element option is set.
Alan Stroop      20100729 1.7.3   Bug fix where duplicate namespace declarations would render on root
                                  element. Fix display issue on attribute namespaces using the wrong
                                  class name.
Alan Stroop      20100809 1.7.4   Adjusted rendered output to allow attributes in xpath expression when 
                                  clicked. Use javascript for determining xpath on node click. Adjusted
                                  so attributes are listed before namespaces.                                                                                                                                        
Alan Stroop      20100814 1.7.5   Fixed issue where some attribute namespaces wouldn't display. Fixed
                                  display issue when Define Namespaces in Root Element is set.
Alan Stroop      20100821 1.7.6   Fixed issue where js error of "$ is not defined" on initial rendering
                                  of xml and reloading the page would fix it. Instead of loading jquery
                                  at render time, it is now fully contained within the rendered output.
Alan Stroop      20100825 1.7.7   Better namespace handling. Added Display XML Declaration and Indent
                                  Size options.
Alan Stroop      20100828 1.8.0   Added Render Method option and functionality due to long transformation
                                  times using libxslt with large xml. Removed Display Namespaces in 
                                  Root Element option. Code cleanup.
Alan Stroop      20100829 1.8.1   Bug fixes for xpath expressions and element collapsing.        
Alan Stroop      20100829 1.8.2   Added XPath Result functionality.
Alan Stroop      20100906 1.8.3   Added Render functionality. Bug fix when rendering "non-xml" XML.        
Alan Stroop      20100906 1.8.4   Added custom Namespace resolver for better XPath Results.
Alan Stroop      20101021 1.9.0   Removed jquery dependency. Removed Render via XSLT and Display Tooltip
                                  Options. Code cleanup.                  
Alan Stroop      20101110 1.9.0.1 Changed <script .../> to <script ...></script> due to Chrome issue
                                  http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=61512

Alan Stroop      20110215 1.9.0.4 Adjusted fuzzy logic for rendering XML disguised as plain text.
Alan Stroop      20110218 1.9.0.5 Changed logic when checking nodeName to use toUpperCase() due to bug
                                  in V8 engine sometimes using lowercase and other times uppercase for
                                  the nodeName results, e.g. span vs SPAN.
Alan Stroop      20110223 1.9.0.6 Added DocType rendering. Bug fix in text() node processing.
Alan Stroop      20110225 1.9.1   Facelift
Alan Stroop      20110312 1.9.1.1 Changes to override native Chrome 11 rendering of non-namespaced xml. 
                                  XML with namespaces currently are rendered via Chrome.

                 20110820 1.9.1.7 Moved Transform functionality to main display    
                 20110830 1.9.1.8 Report non-functionality of xsl:import/xsl:include/document() in XSL widget when
                                  encountered. Added resize functionality to XSL widget. Better handling of XML/XSL 
                                  strings vs. URLs. Changed Transform button to SVG to avoid the button's text being 
                                  included when copying rendered xml.
